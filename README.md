A Logitech Lua Script for Anti recoil. Include a Rapid-Fire function too. Fully customizable,all up to you!

Comes with 6 config slots

As you know,This Lua script is for control those annoying recoil.

It is recommended that you read the notes in the configuration file before using it, and then rebind the buttons. To use the rapid fire function, you need to hold down G5 and the RMB. Runs well on my laptop with GHUB and Logitech G502 Hero Mouse

Anyone is very welcome to make suggestions or point out problems sharply））, :). Maybe I saw it that day and I will revise it

Reminder: The manager of this project is a lazy person（XD. Most of your requests will have to wait half a month to be discovered.
